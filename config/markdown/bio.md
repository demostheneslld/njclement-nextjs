I love solving problems...

During college, I discovered the power of automation during a final project for a class in Government. After spending hours filling a giant spreadsheet with data about social media footprints for hundreds of members of Congress, my hands were hurting from all the clicking, copying, and pasting. I knew there must be a better way. A few Google searches later, I built my first macro, changing the way I thought about work forever. I've spent the years since learning to code from the ground up, one project at a time.

I learned Full Stack Development while automating my first job, eventually building web applications, automating data processes, and creating interactive visualizations of information. Over time, I started working with a team of developers, and took a leadership role in more projects, until I eventually grew to manage a small engineering team: running sprint meetings, planning out architectural decisions, and coordinating tasks between developers.

Few things on Earth satisfy the soul like watching a vision come to life in the hands of a talented and engaged team. I crave that feeling and the fulfillment that comes with it, especially when pursuing objectives that inspire postive, meaningful change in the world, and in the lives of people.
