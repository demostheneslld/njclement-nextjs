She is a nurse, business coordinator, event planner, and the kindest person I have ever met. We have two wonderful dogs named Palmer and Ellie. We met in High School, and after we both came home from college, reconnected, and have spent the years since building a life together. We have overcome massive health challenges, while traveling around the world to London, Italy, and all over the United States.",
    travels: "One of my formative experiences was traveling from Cairo to Cape Town during a semester break Junior year in college. My best friend and I traveled together on an absolutely tiny budget. We saw the pyramids right after the end of the Second Revolution in Egypt, went on a Safari in Kenya, climbed Kilimanjaro with a guide who has become a good friend, visited Victoria Falls, were abandoned by a bus driver at the border of Zambia, explored the deserts of Namibia, and went on a shark diving expedition with great whites in Gansbaai, South Africa. I have continued traveling with my wife, and believe that life is best lived in the pursuit of interesting experiences.",

    health: "I was diagnosed with an extremely rare Liver Disease called Budd Chiari syndrome while the world was still reeling from the COVID pandemic. If not for my wife's intimate knowledge of the medical system in America, and her kindness, and self sacrificial kindness, plus the miracle of modern medicine combined with prayers from many friends and family across the church, I would not be here today. Luckily, I met incredible doctors, and ended up having a DIPS surgery, which has led to an amazing recovery. I am now able to live a full life, and am grateful for every day."

export const bio = `I love solving problems...

During college, I discovered the power of automation during a final project for a class in Government. After spending hours filling a giant spreadsheet with data about social media footprints for hundreds of members of Congress, my hands were hurting from all the clicking, copying, and pasting. I knew there must be a better way. A few Google searches later, I built my first macro, changing the way I thought about work forever. I've spent the years since learning to code from the ground up, one project at a time.

I learned Full Stack Development while automating my first job, eventually building web applications, automating data processes, and creating interactive visualizations of information. Over time, I started working with a team of developers, and took a leadership role in more projects, until I eventually grew to manage a small engineering team: running sprint meetings, planning out architectural decisions, and coordinating tasks between developers.

Few things on Earth satisfy the soul like watching a vision come to life in the hands of a talented and engaged team. I crave that feeling and the fulfillment that comes with it, especially when pursuing objectives that inspire positive, meaningful change in the world, and in the lives of people.

Since the advent of Generative AI, I have stayed on the bleeding edge of the field, connecting with leading researchers, developers, and business leaders to build the future of AI. I am an active contributer towards of the successful AI Biz Hour podcast, and regularly speak and write about the quickly evolving landscape of AI.
